-This project involved creating a C++ application that displays both a 12-hour and 24-hour clock on a website, following ISO 8601 requirements. Chada Tech, a software engineering company, needed dual clock displays on their website to satisfy international clients. The project required secure and efficient user input handling to update and maintain clock displays.

What Was My Success?
I correctly implemented the function application sequence using flowchart diagram logic. My code effectively used functions, minimizing the code in main() and promoting modularization, which improved readability and maintainability.

Where Can I Improve My Code?
Clock displays could be improved. The clocks work but are not displayed side-by-side. Putting the clocks side-by-side would help the software meet the assignment. Refactoring the code to eliminate redundancy and boost efficiency might improve performance. Additional user input checks could prevent buffer overflows and improve security.

The hardest aspect of the code was guaranteeing the right and simultaneous display of both 12-hour and 24-hour clocks in the correct manner. This required extensive debugging and testing to ensure the clocks updated appropriately and maintained their formats. Online forums youtube videosÂ helped me overcome this challenge and ensure correctness.

The skills learned from this project, including modular programming, debugging, and user input handling, are highly applicable to other projects and curriculum. Future programming jobs will benefit from the ability to break down a challenge into smaller, manageable functions and implement them modularly.

Program Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability: I separated the code into modular functions for reuse and modification. The code is well-documented with comments detailing each function's purpose, making it easier to understand and modify. I also followed coding standards and best practices to make the code readable and modifiable.
